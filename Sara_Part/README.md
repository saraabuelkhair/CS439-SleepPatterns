# Sara Part — Sleep, Stress, and GPA Analysis

This folder contains all of my contributions to the CS439 Sleep Patterns project.  
My section focuses on exploring how student lifestyle habits relate to sleep, stress levels,  
and academic performance, using both Tableau and Python-based visualizations.

## Folder Structure

### **1. data_used/**
This folder contains the cleaned datasets that I used for all of my analysis and graphs:
- `cleaned_student_dataset.csv`
- `cleaned_sleep_dataset.csv`

These datasets were cleaned and prepared earlier in the project and used for correlation analysis,  
regression modeling, and visualization.

### **2. tableau_graphs/**
This folder includes all the visualizations I created using Tableau.  
These focus on comparing sleep patterns, stress levels, and GPA relationships across groups.

Files include:
- Average Adult Sleep Hours Bar Plot
- Average Student Sleep Hours Bar Plot
- Distribution of Student Sleep Hours Histogram
- Sleep Duration vs GPA (Students)
- Sleep Hours Affecting Stress Levels Dashboard
- Study Hours vs GPA (Colored by Sleep Duration)
- and others

These graphs help illustrate high-level patterns and comparisons in an easy-to-read format.

### **3. jupyter_graphs/**
This folder includes Python-generated visualizations and the notebooks used to create them.

#### **Jupyter Graphs (PNG):**
- `Correlation Heatmap of Student Lifestyle Variables.png`  
- `Feature Importance for GPA Prediction (Random Forest).png`  

These plots show the relationships between student lifestyle variables and which features  
most strongly predict GPA.

#### **Jupyter Notebooks:**
- `correlation_heatmap_code.ipynb`
- `gpa_prediction_code.ipynb`

Each notebook contains the code used to generate the PNG graphs and includes explanations  
of the results.

## Summary of My Contribution

My analysis focuses on:
- How sleep hours, study hours, stress level, and activity patterns relate to GPA
- Creating visualizations in both Tableau and Python
- Running machine learning models (Random Forest) to identify key predictors of GPA
- Generating correlation heatmaps to summarize student lifestyle relationships

The goal of this section is to explore how student behaviors impact well-being and academic outcomes,  
and to visually present clear trends across the datasets.
