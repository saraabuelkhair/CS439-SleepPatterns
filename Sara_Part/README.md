# Sara Part — Sleep, Stress, and GPA Analysis

This folder includes all of my work for the CS439 Sleep Patterns project.  
My part focuses on understanding how different student lifestyle habits (like sleep, studying, stress, and activity levels) relate to each other and how they connect to academic performance. I used both Tableau and Python to create visualizations that explain these patterns in a clear and easy way.

## Folder Structure

### **1. data_used/**
This folder contains the cleaned datasets I used in my analysis:

- `cleaned_student_dataset.csv`
- `cleaned_sleep_dataset.csv`

These files were cleaned earlier in the project and used for correlation analysis, modeling, and all the graphs. They include the variables I worked with, such as sleep hours, study hours, GPA, physical activity, and stress levels.

---

### **2. tableau_graphs/**
These are all the graphs I created using Tableau. They focus on comparing sleep patterns, stress levels, and GPA relationships for both adults and students.

The files include:

- Average Adult Sleep Hours Bar Plot  
- Average Student Sleep Hours Bar Plot  
- Distribution of Student Sleep Hours Per Day Histogram  
- Sleep Duration vs. GPA (Student Scatter Plot)  
- Sleep Hours Affecting Stress Levels Dashboard  
- Study Hours vs. GPA (Colored by Sleep Duration)

All of these visuals include captions that explain what the graph shows, why I created it, and what the trend means.

### **3. jupyter_graphs/**
This folder includes the graphs I made using Python, along with the Jupyter notebooks I wrote to generate them.

#### **Jupyter Graphs (PNG):**
- `Correlation Heatmap of Student Lifestyle Variables.png`  
- `Feature Importance for GPA Prediction (Random Forest).png`  

These visuals highlight how the different variables relate to one another and which ones matter the most for predicting GPA.

#### **Jupyter Notebooks:**
- `correlation_heatmap_code.ipynb`  
- `gpa_prediction_code.ipynb`  

Each notebook includes the code I used to create the graphs, along with comments explaining the results and why certain patterns appear.

## Summary of My Contribution

In my section, I focused on:

- Analyzing how sleep, study hours, stress levels, and engagement relate to GPA  
- Creating multiple graphs in Tableau to compare adult vs. student patterns  
- Building Python visualizations like heatmaps to explore correlations  
- Running a Random Forest model to see which habits best predict GPA  
- Summarizing which lifestyle factors matter most for academic performance  

Overall, my goal was to understand how students’ daily choices connect to their stress and academic outcomes, and to present those findings in a clear, visual way.
