# CS439-SleepPatterns

## Problem Definition & Project Goal
Our project aims to explore the relationship between sleep patterns, stress levels, and academic performance among college students. We are planning to compare these patterns to the general adult population to understand how lifestyle habits differ between the two groups and how they impact well-being and academic outcomes. Sleep and stress are two major factors affecting students' mental health and academic success. Many students have trouble finding time to study, do extracurricular activities, and sleep, which often leads to higher stress levels and lower academic performance. Our goal is to learn how students' sleep, study, and social habits affect their stress levels and GPAs, and then compare those patterns to the more stable habits of adults. We want to help students figure out how to improve their routines for better mental health and school performance by looking at these factors.
The research question guiding this project is: “How do sleep patterns relate to stress levels and academic performance among students compared with general adults?”

##Data Sources & Preparation

Our project's objective is to investigate the correlation between common student lifestyle patterns and stress, with the goal of determining how these factors impact academic performance. To fulfill this, we decided that we would need two varying datasets to conduct the analysis of this relationship and to support any predictive or affirming models we develop. 

Our main dataset, “Student Lifestyle”, contains 2000 records of students' answers to variables such as Study Hours Per Day, Extracurricular Hours Per Day, Sleep Hours Per Day, Social Hours Per Day, Physical Activity Hours Per Day, GPA, and Stress Level. It displays these variables in a daily average for each student and outputs a corresponding stress level. This dataset will primarily be used to examine the academic and lifestyle balance of students. More specifically, we will investigate the distribution of tasks and their impact on outcomes such as GPA and stress levels. Due to its direct correlation with actions and academic performance, it will serve as the foundation for regression, correlation, and any predictive modeling we undertake in the future. Our second dataset, “Sleep Health,” comprises 375 individuals and provides more detailed information on variables related to physical activity, sleep, and individual health. This dataset can be used to indirectly identify factors that affect a person's overall health, as it includes variables such as Sleep Duration, Quality of Sleep, Physical Activity Level, Stress Level, Heart Rate, Daily Steps, and Sleep Disorder. This dataset differs from the first one in that it approaches this correlation from a biometric and health standpoint, whereas the other tackles it through numbers, allowing for two viewpoints to be considered. Having both ensures that the stress patterns obtained from the first dataset align with the evidence seen in the second dataset.

Both datasets will be imported into Python, then inspected and cleaned using Pandas, and subsequently stored in a MySQL database for organization and SQL querying. Each column name for the datasets will be rewritten for simplicity, and all data types will be converted to numeric or categorical, depending on what's more efficient. For any missing values that may occur, we will be using mode replacement for categorical values and median imputation for numerical attributes. To prevent any heavy outliers, a cap will be set to remove any unrealistic values, and all numerical values will be normalized using z-score scaling. Doing this ensures the removal of outliers, which creates a more consistent distribution, and the z-score scaling ensures consistency across the dataset. Each dataset will be stored in its own clean table within MySQL, and to improve run-time efficiency when running queries and visualization, common columns will be indexed.

SQL will be implemented in this project to filter, query, and combine the two datasets, allowing for more efficient and effective analysis. Although there are no clear identifiers that can be defined to easily combine them, they have similar columns that could be paired up and used. These columns enable us to create a combined SQL dataset using operators such as UNION and ALL, allowing for cross-dataset comparisons between people and students. In conducting this comparison, we aim to gain a clear understanding of which attributes are likely, or in some cases unlikely, to contribute positively or negatively to their daily lives. SQL queries will also be used to group data together, calculate averages, and prepare tables for use in visualizations and modeling.

## Methodology & Machine Learning Approach

Our project’s methodology centers around conducting a structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) and applying machine learning models to identify key factors influencing student stress, sleep, and academic performance. The analysis will be performed using both the “Student Lifestyle” and “Sleep Health and Lifestyle” datasets to ensure a comprehensive understanding of how daily habits, physical activity, and rest patterns correlate with stress and GPA outcomes. 

The first step will involve exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python’s Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries to visualize relationships between key variables. We will generate pair plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps to identify the strongest associations between lifestyle factors and academic indicators. Statistical summaries including mean, median and standard deviation, as well as outlier detection will help guide model selection and preprocessing decisions. EDA will also be used to assess multicollinearity between predictors, ensuring that our chosen features provide unique and relevant insights. 

Once trends and relationships are identified, we will proceed with predictive and classification modeling. For continuous outcomes such as GPA and stress level, linear regression and random forest regression models will be implemented to capture both linear and nonlinear relationships among lifestyle variables. linear regression will serve as a baseline model to interpret feature coefficients and determine direct correlations, while random forest will provide insight into feature importance and handle potential nonlinearities. For categorical outcomes such as “Sleep Disorder” or “Stress Level Category”, K-means clustering and decision tree classification may be used to identify natural groupings and classify individuals based on behavioral patterns. 

Model evaluation will be conducted using appropriate performance metrics. For regression models, metrics such as R² (coefficient of determination), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) will be used to assess prediction accuracy and error magnitude. For classification tasks, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score will be used to evaluate model performance and robustness. Cross-validation will also be implemented to ensure generalizability and minimize overfitting.

By analyzing both datasets, we aim to identify consistent patterns linking stress, sleep quality, and academic outcomes. Insights from the “Student Lifestyle” dataset will highlight behavioral trends, while findings from the “Sleep Health” dataset will reveal physiological and health related influences. Combining both of these perspectives will allow us to form conclusions regarding student well being and performance, ultimately supporting actionable recommendations for improving student balance and academic success. 

## Tools & Expected Results

We will be coding the project using VS Code as our platform, and we’ll perform all analysis and modeling in Python using libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning. We will also use MySQL for database management to store and query the data, ensuring smooth analysis. To make the project collaborative, we’ll use GitHub to track our progress, share our code, and ensure that everyone in the group can contribute to the project seamlessly.
We expect to find that students with less sleep will likely have higher stress levels and lower GPAs, while the general adult population may show more stable sleep patterns and moderate stress levels. These findings will be presented through various visualizations, such as graphs, correlation heatmaps, and dashboards, making it easy to see how sleep, stress, and academic performance are related.
